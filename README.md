# CAN Bus Hub

WARNING: Hub/Star topology is NOT recommended for a CAN bus. Use with heavy caution. Don't use if you don't know exactly what you are doing. 


Hub for a CAN bus. Add 1/4W 120 ohm axial resistor (6.5mm) or wires (~2mm diameter) as needed to the edge of the board. Use 2 holes next to the solder pad as strain relief if adding. Secure board with M4 screw. Make sure any unterminated stub is less than 30cm long.
